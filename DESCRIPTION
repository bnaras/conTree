Title: Contrast Trees and Boosting
Description: Contrast trees represent a new approach for assessing the
    accuracy of many types of machine learning estimates that are not
    amenable to standard (cross) validation methods. In situations
    where inaccuracies are detected, boosted contrast trees can often
    improve performance. Functions are provided to to build such trees
    in addition to a special case, distribution boosting, an
    assumption free method for estimating the full probability
    distribution of an outcome variable given any set of joint input
    predictor variable values.
